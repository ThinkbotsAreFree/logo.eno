i start from 2 languages i love:

- **logo** is an educational programming language designed in 1967 by Wally Feurzeig, Seymour Papert, and Cynthia Solomon. it is a multi-paradigm adaptation and dialect of lisp.
- **eno** is a modern plaintext data format for file-based content, designed and developed with great enthusiasm and dedication by Simon Repp. eno exists since early 2018.
